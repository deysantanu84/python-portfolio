# Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent
# values and weights associated with N items respectively.
# Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
# Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset
# is smaller than or equal to C.
# NOTE:
# You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
# 1 <= N <= 500
# 1 <= C, B[i] <= 10^6
# 1 <= A[i] <= 50
# First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
# Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
# Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.
# Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A
# such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
