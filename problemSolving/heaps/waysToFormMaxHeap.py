# Max Heap is a special kind of complete binary tree in which for every node
# the value present in that node is greater than the value present in itâ€™s children nodes.
# Find the number of distinct Max Heap can be made from A distinct integers.
# In short, you have to ensure the following properties for the max heap :
# Heap has to be a complete binary tree ( A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level,
# except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.)
# Every node is greater than all its children.
# NOTE: If you want to know more about Heaps, please visit this link. Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
# 1 <= A <= 100
# First and only argument is an integer A.
# Return an integer denoting the number of distinct Max Heap.
