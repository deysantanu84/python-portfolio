# Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into
# the numerically next greater permutation of numbers for a given array A of size N.
# If such arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the lowest possible order
# i.e., sorted in an ascending order.
# NOTE: The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.
# DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR NEXT PERMUTATION.
# Use of Library functions will disqualify your submission retroactively and will give you penalty points.
# 1 <= N <= 5 * 10^5
# 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
