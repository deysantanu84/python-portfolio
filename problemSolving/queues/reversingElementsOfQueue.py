# Given an array of integers A and an integer B.
# We need to reverse the order of the first B elements of the array,
# leaving the other elements in the same relative order.
# NOTE: You are required to first insert elements into an auxiliary queue
# then perform Reversal of first B elements.
# 1 <= B <= length of the array <= 500000
# 1 <= A[i] <= 100000
