# There are N Mice and N holes that are placed in a straight line.
# Each hole can accommodate only 1 mouse.
# The positions of Mice are denoted by array A and the position of holes are denoted by array B.
# A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1,
# or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.
# Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.
# 1 <= N <= 10^5
# -109 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^9
# First argument is an integer array A.
# Second argument is an integer array B.
# Return an integer denoting the minimum time when the last mouse gets inside the holes.
