# Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N.
# Element C[i] represents length of ith board.
# You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1].
# There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of board.
# Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all boards
# under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.
# NOTE:
# 1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say,
# a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
# 2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards.
# Which means a configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
# Return the ans % 10000003.
# 1 <= A <= 1000
# 1 <= B <= 10^6
# 1 <= N <= 10^5
# 1 <= C[i] <= 10^6
