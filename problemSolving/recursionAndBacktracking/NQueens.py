# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard
# such that no two queens attack each other.
# Given an integer A, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
# where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
# 1 <= A <= 10
# First argument is an integer n denoting the size of chessboard
# Return an array consisting of all distinct solutions in which each element
# is a 2d char array representing a unique solution.
