# Given an integer array A of size N denoting collection of numbers,
# return all possible permutations.
# NOTE:
# No two entries in the permutation sequence should be the same.
# For the purpose of this problem, assume that all the numbers in the collection are unique.
# WARNING: DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING PERMUTATIONS.
# Example : next_permutations in C++ / itertools.permutations in python.
# If you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.
# 1 <= N <= 9
